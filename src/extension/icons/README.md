# Extension Icons

## Icon Requirements

The extension needs the following icon sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16)
- icon48.png (48x48)
- icon128.png (128x128)

## How to Add Icons

1. Create or design icons with the required sizes
2. Save them as PNG files in this directory
3. Name them according to the sizes above

## Temporary Note

Currently, placeholder icons are needed. You can:
- Design custom icons for the project
- Use icon generator tools
- Create simple placeholder icons

The extension will work without icons, but the visual appearance will be limited.
